# Training Examples for Instant TDD

These are the training examples to accompany the Udemy course _Instant TDD_ with Ashley Frieze.

Each of the folders within this repository is an appropriately example from the course with a name that matches the one used in the training video.

## Examples

- `leapYear2` - the extended TDD example around leap years

- `articleSender` - lightweight demonstration of Mockito
- `articleSender2` - MockitoJUnitRunner refactor of the demo
- `assertions` - various ways of performing assertions with JUnit, Hamcrest and AssertJ along with asserting for exception and timeout
- `leapyearparameterized` - conversion of leap year to use parameterized runners - both JUnit's own and JUnitParams
- `testfolder` - examples of both `@Before` and `@After` being used as well as the `@Rule` for `TemporaryFolder`
